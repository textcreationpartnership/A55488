            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But then our Almes muſt be done without looking on our ſelves as if we were benefactors, and doners unto God, but as humble <hi>Debtors, or Farmers</hi> paying, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his due rent; not with any preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>redeeming, or buying off, our Sins;</hi> but in the form of an humble Suppliant, and Petitioner, and with tears of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction, juſt as a good man will give ſome recompence (ſuch as he can) to his injured Brother, as a Teſtimony, and acknowledgement of the offence, &amp; of his ſorrow: So a good Chriſtian conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his <hi>Almes,</hi> as a <hi>part of his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This Chriſtian duty is moreover, ſweetned by moſt gracious promiſes of reward, as high as any other, even with the inheritance of heaven, when it is ſaid, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father,</hi> &amp;c.] A great purchaſe for a ſmall price, and this, not becauſe Heaven is Vile, or Cheap, but becauſe our Lord is graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.

how that can be called a lending, which is an abſolute gift; the anſwer is, that though it be a free gift to the poor, yet it is a lending to God, becauſe he doth ingage himſelf to re-pay. The Fathers tranſlate the word Lend by <hi>[faeneratur,]</hi> as lent to God upon <hi>Uſury,</hi> or increaſe, which they call <note n="a" place="margin">

               <hi>immortal Uſury;</hi> as if the Scripture took notice of our cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, thereby to invite us to works of Charity for our own profit. The holy Woman <hi>Hannah</hi> ſaid truly, <hi>The Lord</hi>

            <p>This is the reaſon that the Scriptures promiſe <hi>Treaſures in Heaven,</hi> and that <hi>the merciful are bleſsed, and ſhall obtain</hi>

               <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 9.) That then, <hi>Mercy will ſtand between them and Hell, and will not ſuffer any of the merciful to paſs that way.</hi> Thus they.

                  <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. 30.</note> very conſiderable as we read, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41. 1. as Chriſt in the Goſpel promiſeth an <hi>hundred-fold reward in this time to them that for his ſake, leave Houſes, Brethen, Sisters, VVives, Children, and Lands,]</hi> which promiſe is warily to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, becauſe ſome <hi>Millinarians</hi> would have it to be meant <hi>groſly, and literally,</hi> as if for one houſe, or one Father, they muſt have an hundred houſes and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers here, a falſe gloſs ſurely; For I trow, they expect not to have an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Wives, neither doth the promiſe mention Wives, though the condition do. The meaning is, That they who ſo part with eſtates, and friends, ſhall have both, multiplied unto them; for to them
<pb facs="tcp:96408:8"/>
every true Chriſtian, Man, and Woman, ſhall be by love, care, and tender affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as ſo many Fathers, Brethen, Wives, or Siſters, miniſtring comforts to them.

               <p>Touching the difficulties in the Doctrine of the holy <hi>Trinity,</hi> and of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> and other Miſteries. Let us ſee what the ancient and moſt learned Divines thought. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <note n="d" place="margin">Aug. confeſ. l. 13. De Tem. Ser. 189. Soliloq c. 31. De verb. Apoſt. Ser. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Trinitatem quis non loquitur, &amp; quis intelligit?—Angeli in caelo Trinitatem ſcire non poſſunt, diunt, Quis eſt Rex gloriae?</hi> And <hi>Trinitas tua tibi ſoli integre nota eſt, quis cognovit te, niſi tu te?</hi> and ſo he concludeth, <hi>Tu ratiotinare, ego mirer, tu diſputa, Ego cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> i. e.

                  </note> whilſt others argue, and diſpute, I will only admire and beleeve. Thus he.</p>
               <p>As concerning the Myſtery of Gods <hi>Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> and <hi>Election. Origen</hi> inquiring why <hi>Jacob</hi> was loved, and <hi>Eſau</hi> hated, before they <note place="margin">Ro. 9. 13.</note> were born, thus anſwereth, <note n="e" place="margin">Orig. in Gen.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96408:24"/>
and his Auditors knowledg to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. Thus, this Learned man acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his inſufficiency in theſe high Myſteries, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though at another time he tells us, <note n="f" place="margin">Rapit nos de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderium, ad ea quae magis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcura ſunt, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerenda.

               <p>So we finde in <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Proſper,</hi> many ſuch paſſages, whereby they acknowledg their neſcience in ſuch high matters. As 1. <hi>Why an Infant at the very birth of it, was found to be poſſeſſed with a Devil?</hi> 2. <hi>Why one obtaineth the grace of Chriſtianity, and Baptiſm, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not?</hi> 3. <hi>Why God puniſheth one, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beareth another, when both are in the ſame fault?</hi> 4. <hi>Why God granteth not the grace of Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to ſome, unto whom he hath given the grace of Chriſtian Charity?</hi> 5. <hi>Why he ſuffereth the children of ſome holy men to depart out of this life, without Baptiſm, or any knowledg of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; and yet ſo diſpoſeth, that the children of his very enemies, and of Heathen Idolaters, come into the Cuſtody of good Chriſtians, and ſo receive and embrace Chriſtian Religion?</hi> 6. <hi>Why ſome Infants are ſaved, and others not, when neither of them were better qualified in order thereunto, one, then the other?</hi> 7. <hi>Why he with holdeth ſome holy Profeſſors from falling away, and not others?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To all theſe <hi>Queſtions,</hi> and many ſuch like, the only Anſwers we finde are, <hi>Inſcrutabile eſt—ſcrutetur qui poteſt—Nemo ex me ſcire quaerat, quod me neſcire ſcio—Credamus De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um beneficiſſe, etſi nondum novimus quare fecit</hi>

The cauſe may be hidden from us, but it cannot be unjuſt in God.

                  <hi>Son, but darkly of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> becauſe God would not ingage us in this part of Faith, until the God-head of the Father and the Son were more cleerly manifeſted; thus by degrees, like the Sun-light, illuminating man by little and little.

                  <note place="margin">Epiph. haer. 74.</note> who denied the God-head of the holy Ghoſt, that <hi>Moſes plainly declareth one God, and the Prophets, two Perſons in God, and the Apoſtles a Trinity of Perſons:</hi> And we are told by St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Proaem.

               </p>
               <p>Indeed, we finde in after times, that both <hi>Heathens and Hereticks</hi> objected, that the Chriſtians had <hi>two, or three Gods,</hi> upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of a plurality of Perſons: For <hi>Porphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> called the Chriſtians Trinity, <note n="b" place="margin">Aug. de Civ. l. 10. c. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>Three Gods.</hi> So the <hi>Macedonian Hereticks</hi> called the Catholicks, <note n="c" place="margin">Naz. Orat. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>Tritheitas,</hi> as if they had three Gods; but they were thus anſwered by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen;</hi> That <hi>if the Catholicks were ſo becauſe they confeſſed Three Perſons, then muſt thoſe Macedonians be called Bideitae, becauſe they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged two Perſons, viz.</hi> The Father, and the Son.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arians</hi> confeſſed <hi>Three Perſons;</hi> but they denyed the <hi>

               <p>Now that it may appear, that the Myſtery of the <hi>Trinity</hi> is not ſo far remote from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane capacity and faith, as if to Reaſon it might ſeem altogether impoſſible<hi>:</hi> God hath given us many reſemblances thereof, which are obvious and eaſie to be diſcerned; which Similitudes muſt not be thought fully to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond in all particulars, to the Divine <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> as we learn in <hi>Logick, Omne ſimile eſt diſſimile.

Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes do always halt with one foot. But it will be enough if we can finde ſome one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular wherein they are aſſimulated.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96408:29"/>

               </p>
               <p>Yet, when we ſay, the Three Perſons are but of <hi>one Eſſence,</hi> the Reader is to be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96408:29"/>
that we are not ſo to be underſtood; as if we affirmed that there is no <hi>Eſſential, or Quid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditative difference</hi> between theſe Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; for the Three Divine Perſons, muſt needs be diſtinct, and different in ſome Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial difference; otherwiſe, they all muſt be confeſſed to be but One Perſon<hi>:</hi> Therefore ſomething there muſt be, whereby the <hi>Father is Father, and not Son;</hi> and ſo in the other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to conſtitute them, Perſons diſtinct each from other: For in <hi>Logick</hi> we learn, that even the very <hi>Accidents have their reſpective Eſſence,</hi> (ſuch as it is) to make them what they are, &amp; ſo muſt the ſeveral Divine Perſons; have and to this our Orthodox Divines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, for thus they write. <hi>Perſonae habent unum eſſe abſolutum, Eſſentiale, Naturale; Sed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſum eſſe Relativum, &amp; Perſonale,</hi> i. e. The Three Perſons have but one Eſſence abſolute of their own nature, but Diverſe Eſſences Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative and Perſonal. So that theſe ſeveral Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences or Acts, and Quiddities, are not in the <hi>abſolute nature</hi> or God-head of them, but in the <hi>Relative Perſonalities;</hi> for they are all Abſolutely but One God, and yet they are diſtinct and ſeveral Perſons; they are intirely and truly <hi>One thing,</hi> and as truly, Three <hi>ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things:</hi> Which St. <hi>Anſelm,</hi> (as it ſeemeth to me) doth very acutely thus determine, and expreſs, <note place="margin">Anſelm. de incarn. c. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Tres Res ſunt, &amp; una res,</hi> viz. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>na res Abſoluta: Tres res Relativae. In uno Communi unum ſunt, ſc. Dietate, In tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Proprietatibus Diverſae ſunt,</hi> i. e. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſons are Three things, and they are
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96408:30"/>
but One Thing, <hi>viz.</hi> They are Three things Relatively, but One thing Abſolutely; for in one common thing they are but One, that is one in Eſſence or God-head, but Three in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or Proprieties. <hi>Thus he,</hi> and much more to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>If it be enquired what thoſe <hi>Propertics</hi> are, which are peculiar to each Perſon, and that do diſtinguiſh every Perſon each from other: In this we are plentifully reſolved by former Writers. <hi>Richardus de St. Victore,</hi> thus ſets <note place="margin">Rich. de St. Vict. de Trinit. c. 15. and 25.</note> down their perſonal Proprieties. <hi>Pater dat ſolum: Filius accipit &amp; dat, Spiritus accipit ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi> i. e. The Father giveth only: The Son receiveth and giveth: The Spirit receiveth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from both<hi>:</hi> There cannot be another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, or Perſon, which neither giveth, nor taketh; for if ſo, then we ſhould be driven to confeſs a <hi>Quaternity</hi> of Perſons inſtead of a <hi>Trinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſets down the Proprieties in theſe words: <hi>Ingenitus, Genitus, Procedens,</hi> i. e. <note place="margin">Naz. Orat. 23. and Orat. 28. Baſil. Epiſt. 349.</note> Unbegotten, Begotten, Proceeding: And St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> thus. <hi>Paternitas, Filiatio, Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cativa poteſtas,</hi> i. e. Fatherhood Sonſhip, Sanctificative power; for although the Father and the Son do Sanctifie, yet they do it not immediately by themſelves, but mediately by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> who is the <hi>Spirit of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If therefore each Perſon have any one thing peculiar and proper to it ſelf, and incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to any other of the Divine Perſons; this Property muſt needs prove it to be a ſeveral,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96408:30"/>
and <hi>distinct Perſon.</hi> And if there be any one <hi>Perſon</hi> in the God-head, which doth neither give to the Other, nor receive from the Other; This muſt needs prove a Perſon without any communion with the other, and ſo the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> would be loſt.</p>
               <p>Now that it may by the Scriptures appear that there are ſeveral Proprieties in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Perſons, and thoſe incommunicable to the other Perſons. We read that <hi>The Son is the Image of the Father]</hi> but it is never read that the Father is the Image of the Son, or Spirit; So it is ſaid, <hi>The Word (or Son) was made fleſh]</hi> but neither the Father, nor the Spirit, are ever ſaid to be made fleſh. So the Son is called <hi>The only Begotten]</hi> ſo is not the Father or the Spirit; therefore the Ancient Writers called the Father <hi>Ingenitum, Innaſcibilem, Impaſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> i. e. Not Begotten, not Born, not Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; nor can the Father be ſaid to <hi>proceed</hi> from the Son or Spirit<hi>:</hi> But theſe Properties cannot be affirmed of the Son, who is Begotten, born, and ſuffered; nor of the Holy Ghoſt, who proceedeth from the Father, and the Son. Beſides theſe, The Scripture doth cleerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the ſeveral <hi>Perſonalities</hi> in the God-head by our Saviours words, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14, 15. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall ſend another Comforter]</hi> Here is evidently a diſtinct Trinity. <hi>I,</hi> and <hi>He,</hi> and <hi>Another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As touching the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the <hi>Three Perſons,</hi> the <hi>Arians</hi> utterly deny it; and therefore they expoſtulated with the Catholicks, becauſe in the aſſerting thereof, they uſed ſome words

               <p>The Scriptural evidence for the reality and truth of the thing is cleer; For at the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of Chriſt, the <hi>Three Perſons,</hi> did diſtinctly, ſenſibly, and ſeparatly ſhew, or declare their preſence at one time: The <hi>Father audibly by a voice.

                  </gap>, The <hi>Epiphanie</hi> or manifeſtation of <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> and he alſo calls that Apparition, <hi>Theophania,</hi> i. e. the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God. And moreover tells us of this Feſtival of the <hi>Epiphany</hi> (which even in his days was ſolemnized by the Church) That is, was kept for the commemoration, not of the Nativity, but of the Baptiſm of Chriſt; and for this reaſon, the <hi>Church of England</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, that, on the Feaſt of <hi>Epiphany,</hi> the third Chapter of St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſhould be read, as a Leſſon proper for that day, wherein the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm <note place="margin">Luk. 3. 21.</note> of Chriſt and this Apparition is declared: for therefore it was called <hi>Epiphany,</hi> becauſe at this Baptiſm the Lord Jeſus was by the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt openly proclaimed to be That Son of God, and that Meſſiah which had been before promiſed, and Propheſied, in whom only, God would be <hi>well pleaſed,</hi> and <hi>be at peace</hi> with man.</p>
               <p>And ſurely, that Heavenly and Myſterious Apparition of the two other Perſons, was alſo for a further reach and purpoſe; namely to declare to the world, that this <hi>Jeſus</hi> was that man which was aſſumed into <hi>Perſonal union</hi> with the God-head; and that this <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> or God incarnate, was hereby declared to be aſſumed into the number of the <hi>Trinity</hi> at that time; Although, in reſpect of his pure God-head, and as he was God the Word, he was One of the Perſons of the Trinity before, and alſo from Eternity: And although this <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel,</hi> or God incarnate, was one of the Three Divine Perſons, at the firſt inſtant and

moment of his Incarnation, yet he was not ſo declared, and manifeſted to be ſo, until this glorious Apparition.</p>
               <p>For this very cauſe it may with great reaſon be thought, that in correſpondence to this Apparition at his own Baptiſm; when he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards preſcribed the form and words of Baptiſm for all Chriſtians<hi>:</hi> He ſtrictly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that they ſhould be baptized <hi>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> In the Original it is, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>So likewiſe, the Hereſie of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> who denied the <hi>Perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of the <hi>God-head and Manhood</hi> in Chriſt, and thereby divided Chriſt, making <hi>two Perſons of One,</hi> did thus bring in a <hi>fourth Perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the Hereſie of <hi>Macedonius,</hi> who deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the God-head of the Holy-Ghoſt, inſtead of a Trinity, allowed but a <hi>Binity</hi> of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>Theſe Hereſies ſo moved and diſturbed the Church Catholick, that for the aſſerting this holy, neceſary, and ſcriptural Doctrine of Three Perſons in one God-head, they were forced to uſe this word <hi>Trinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is yet another Quarrel about the word <hi>Perſon,</hi> becauſe this word is not found in Scripture, to be ſo uſed as the Church both preſent and Primitive, have applied it; for even thoſe that do confeſs that there is a <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> in the God-head, yet why this Trinity, and theſe Three, ſhould be called <hi>three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> is that that troubleth them.</p>
               <p>Indeed the Scripture often nameth <hi>Three,</hi> the Father, Son, and Spirit: and it ſaith, <hi>There are Three,</hi> but even St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelf, often demandeth, <note n="a" place="margin">Aug. de Trin. lib. 5. c. 9. lib. 8. proaen.</note>

                  </gap>) juſt as light is of the Sun, and this word may teach us, the <hi>Coeternity</hi> of the Perſon of the Son, with the Perſon of the Father, as the light of the Sun is Coetanious with the Sun it ſelf.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Another ſhrewd <hi>Scandal</hi> is given by the late omiſſion, and diſuſe of the <hi>Doxolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi> or glorification of the Trinity, which now a days is by moſt incumbents quite left, as if the Doctrine of the Trinity were not true; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ancient Chriſtians, and this Church of <hi>England</hi> ſo often uſed it as a confeſſion of the true Catholick faith, and in deteſtation of the infidelity of <hi>Jews, Samoſatenians, Arians, and Macedonians;</hi> for although ſome of them did uſe a form of glorification of the Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, both privately and publickly, even almoſt as often as they fetcht their breath<hi>:</hi> as <note n="a" place="margin">Baſil. de Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. c. 25.</note> St. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith; yet it was with a diſparagement both of the Second and Third Perſons, ſo as is ſhewed before; therefore the Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick was neceſſarily moved to glorifie all the Three Perſons equally, according to that form of words which Chriſt appointed in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:96408:48"/>
But now we ſeldom hear the Ancient <hi>Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie</hi> at all reherſed in moſt Congregations, and which is worſe, the reherſing of it is accounted to be prejudicial, and dangerous to the reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer; and it hath been confeſſed by one in mine own knowledge, who is learned and Orthodox, that although he approved of the Doxologie, yet he abſtained from reherſing it, or from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing it to be ſung when others deſired it, ſo as it is ſet down in many places of thoſe <hi>Hymns</hi> which are joined with the ſinging Pſalmes, which are yet in uſe amongſt us (more then the Liturgical reading Pſalmes are) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thoſe ſinging Pſalmes and Hymns were never authorized by any Legiſlative power; and this he did, not for any diſlike thereof, but for fear of offending ſome Reformers, and thereby indangering his livelyhood.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another block of obſtructions is: That the <hi>Symbols</hi> of faith, the Creeds, are in moſt Congregations quite diſuſed: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the confeſſion of our faith in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and our aſſent to all the neceſſary Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Chriſtianity is expreſſed; yet this is now omitted, and even in Baptiſm alſo, where it is moſt needful: for although we finde not that the Creed was uſed in the primitive Church in their <hi>general Liturgies,</hi> yet it was never with them omitted in the adminiſtration of Baptiſm. <hi>G. Caſſander</hi> obſerveth, <note n="b" place="margin">Caſſand in Liturgicis.</note> That the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed in the days of <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Chryſostom,</hi> was rehearſed at the time of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> only, where none were preſent, but only the <hi>Fideles,</hi> i. e. Communicants. So, that Creed which
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:96408:49"/>
we call Apoſtolical, was always uſed at Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> tells us, that at the three dippings in Baptiſm, which was the cuſtome in his time at <hi>Millan,</hi> the perſon to be baptized was thrice asked. <note n="c" place="margin">Ambr. de Sac. l. 2. c. 7. r.</note>

                  </gap>ty to be baptized, did himſelf openly in the Church (if he were at age) rehearſe the Creed, and declare his aſſent to the Articles of faith therein; ſo that it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed a ſign of inſolency and pride, if a man would have another to rehearſe it, that ſo he might only ſignifie his aſſent, and not rehearſe it by himſelf perſonally. And to this purpoſe he tells a ſtory of one <note n="e" place="margin">Aug. Epiſt. 67</note> 
                  <hi>Gabinianus,</hi> who had a long time deſerred to be baptized; this man had one only Daughter, and ſhe fell ſick, her father then bound himſelf by vow, to be baptized, if his child recovered: ſhe did reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, yet he performed not his vow; then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was ſtruck blind, and thereupon vowed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and received his ſight, and was baptized, But would not then at Baptiſm rehearſe the Creed by himſelf<hi>:</hi> then he fell into a grievous Palſie, which hindred his ſpeech; and was in a Dream admoniſhed, that this calamity fell upon him, becauſe he omitted the rehearſal of the Creed in his Baptiſm. Then (becauſe he could
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:96408:49"/>
not ſpeak) he gave up the Creed under his hand writing, and was reſtored to the uſe of his Limbs, but not of ſpeech. <hi>Thus he.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Surely, the confeſſion of faith ought not to be omitted at Baptiſm, becauſe Baptiſm is our ſubmitting and reſtipulating to the Covenant of Grace, which Covenant cannot by us poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be performed, but only through faith in Chriſt, by which faith inſtrumentally, we are united to Chriſt, and in him to the whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity<hi>:</hi> So that the principal branch of this Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal Covenant, is to be a <hi>faithful beleever:</hi> I marvel therefore how it can ſeem reaſonable to any man that underſtandeth Baptiſm, and eſpecially to our learned Teachers; that one ſhould enter a Covenant in Baptiſm, of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, when the things to be confeſſed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved are not at all rehearſed, or mentioned. And yet more ſtrange it is, that although they have changed the old form of ſinging with the <hi>ſigne of the Croſs,</hi> into ſinging with the <hi>ſigne of the Covenant;</hi> yet the words of the Covenant are not at all by them rehearſed: Whereas it is evident in Scripture, that a confeſſion of faith, and ſo a Covenant of beleeving is required in Baptiſm; for when the Noble <hi>Eunuch</hi> deſired Baptiſm, he was firſt required to beleeve, and thereupon made a confeſſion of his faith, thus, <hi>I beleeve that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God;</hi> and <note place="margin">Act. 8. 37.</note> ſo he was baptized. As for the reforming of great <hi>Fonts</hi> into little <hi>Baſons,</hi> and the like leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer matters, wherein, how much the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is better then the ſuppoſed fault or defect, we diſpute not; but we are heartily ſorry, that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:96408:50"/>
in many Congregations, the Incumbents do often refuſe to baptize at all, except it be the children of the Rich, of their own fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, We have alſo loſt the grave and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable <hi>Order Epiſcopal,</hi> which may juſtly ſeem to argue a diſ-belief, or a diſparagement of the Holy-Ghoſt, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. <hi>Spiritus ſanctus poſuit Epiſcopos]</hi> for if it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed beleeved, that the holy ſpirit did plant, or place them; it muſt alſo be believed that ſome contrary <hi>Ghoſt,</hi> or <hi>Anti-ſpirit</hi> it is that ſupplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them. Our Lord Jeſus himſelf; now, ſince he ſate at the right hand of God, in Heaven, yet there ſitting, is called a Biſhop, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 25. <hi>The Shepherd and Biſhop of our ſouls;</hi> and the chief Shepherd, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 4.

The Appellation of <hi>Paſtor</hi> belonged only to Biſhops in the Primitive Church, but but now every young Curat, though but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truder, will write himſelf <hi>Paſtor,</hi> too arrogant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: St. <hi>John,</hi> in his Revelation, ſaw four and <note place="margin">Rev. 4. 10.</note> twenty <hi>Presbiters</hi> (ſo is the original) fall down before this great Biſhop; but our new Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations have ſhewen us twenty four Biſhops falling before Presbyters.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe that the greateſt adverſaries of Epiſcopacy, will not deny the Title of Biſhop to be a ſcriptural word, as it is, and not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary or temporary word, or appellation, as ſome others are, but a poſitive and fixed name, and office: and if it be indeed ſo planted by the Holy Ghoſt in the holy Scriptures;

                  <hi>And if any ſhall take away from it, God ſhall take away his part out of the book of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The greateſt Sticklers, and Dogmatical op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, and enemies to Epiſcopacy (for I med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle not with Authoritative power) are thoſe men who would have <hi>Presbyters</hi> to be the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Sacerdotal order; but I firmly beleeve that in the Scripture, the word <hi>Presbyter</hi> was not intended to ſignifie any order at all of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdocy,</hi> but only to ſignifie a juriſdictive Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority annexed to the two only Orders of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and Miniſter;</hi> for Biſhops are therefore called Presbyters in the Scripture, becauſe of their juriſdiction only. Presbyter is an appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Office, or work of a Biſhop, but not of his Order, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth evidently diſtinguiſh them, 1 Tim. 3. 1. <hi>If a man deſire the Office of a Biſhop, he deſireth a good Work.]</hi> Here is, 1.

                  </gap>. Afterwards, inferior Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters were called Presbyters; and that very early in the Primitive Church: And now all Miniſters are generally called Presbyters, which is improper and abuſive, except there be firſt a faculty of ſome part of the Eccleſiaſtical juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction annexed to the Miniſter, which juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, in due form, ſhould be derived on
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:96408:51"/>
them, by grant of the Superiour Order of the Biſhop: for although it is very true, that in the Primitive Church a new Order was ſet up, and called Presbyters, and placed between Biſhops and Miniſters (<gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> tells us of an <hi>Aegyptian Queen (Iſis)</hi> that gave the third part of her Land to Prieſts, to hire them to cry up her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Husband for a God<hi>:</hi> And we are told by <note n="b" place="margin">Euſ. de Praep. lib. 1. c. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Euſebius</hi> of an <hi>Aegyptian King,</hi> that ſet up ſeveral Religions in the ſeveral Provinces of that Country, that thereby the people might be divided, and ſo deſpiſe and hate one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Religion, leaſt they ſhould agree in one, and ſo conſpire againſt their King; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it ſeems that <hi>Divide, &amp; Impera,</hi> was an old Egyptian-Heatheniſh policy; but ſurely <hi>Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge &amp; Impera,</hi> is the better, and more Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>There are alſo many Religions among us (I cannot ſay for what policy) and many old re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived Hereſies brought in, as <hi>Arianiſm by So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians: Donatiſm by Anabaptiſts: Aeria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm, by the Anti-prelaticals:</hi> And <hi>Judaiſm by ſome Sabbatarians:</hi> And <hi>Millinariſm by our new Chiliaſts, (or Millers,</hi> as our Country peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple call them) whilſt the true Chriſtian, and <hi>Engliſh-Catholick</hi> Religion is by all thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties contemned, and depraved, as is ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in divers particulars, to which I muſt add one more, which is a great <hi>ſcandal</hi> alſo againſt the Perſon of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fifth, <hi>The Lords Prayer</hi> is now in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces omitted, and quite diſ-uſed; whereby ſome people have taken occaſion, moſt impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly

and curſedly to blaſpheme both it, and alſo the Author of it; they call it the <hi>Devils Faggot-bond;</hi> and they ſay that <hi>Chriſt</hi> (if he were now on earth) <hi>would be aſhamed of it,</hi> &amp;c. ſurely thoſe <hi>Demagogues</hi> that do thus principle their Diſciples, are the right ſcandalous Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and no good teachers, as one ſaith, <note n="c" place="margin">Plaut. in Bach.</note>

                  <hi>Serpens praeconiavit in Marcion,</hi> i. e. either <hi>Marcions</hi> Chaplain, or he that in the Serpent Preached to <hi>Eve:</hi> For this Prayer was taught us by that God to whom we are to pray, as if the Prince himſelf ſhould pen our Petition, wherewith he would be petitioned, that ſo he might the more cheerfully, and unſcrupulouſly grant it: Wherein we are minded firſt of our Adoption by the Son of God, and whereby we ſay, <hi>Our Father:</hi> and it was by the beſt Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, dayly uſed; and of ſuch reverend eſteem by the faithful, that none might preſume to uſe it, until they were Chriſtened (that is) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til in Baptiſm they had received the Sacrament of Adoption, as we are informed by <note n="e" place="margin">Chryſ.

                  <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom, Auſtin, and Theodoret.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may go for a <hi>Riddle,</hi> that this Prayer is not only omitted, but Preached and declaimed againſt, by thoſe men that would have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that Chriſt will come down from Heaven corporally, and raign here upon earth with his Saints, that is, with themſelves, a thouſand years before the laſt judgment; which Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, if theſe men do beleeve, and deſire his ſo coming, it may be wondred why they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to pray, <hi>Thy Kingdom come.</hi>

In this they ſeem, not to be their Crafts-maſters, becauſe this omiſſion giveth occaſion to the other party to ſuſpect, that theſe Saints do not themſelves believe this <hi>Millinarian fancie,</hi> which they pretend; and alſo that they do really fear leſt Chriſts Kingdom ſhould indeed come<hi>:</hi> Becauſe, if <hi>his Kingdom come,</hi> then <hi>his Will muſt be done, On earth, as it is in Heaven;</hi> that is, Cheerfully, willingly, and charitably; according to his own Evangelical precepts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Blood-ſhedding, or Rapine<hi>:</hi> then no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, no hypocriſie, no ſlandering, or malicious lying, and envying wil take place; and then there wil be a reſtitution of all things, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 21. <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>Chriſts coming hath in Scripture a double ſignification.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By his Spirit, ruling in our hearts; this is his Kingdom of grace, and the Kingdom of God, which is within us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It ſignifyeth his coming in particular judgment, in wrath and vengeance upon a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and rebellious people, neither of theſe do neceſſarily imply his corporal coming.</p>
               <p>Verily, it is not unprobable, that Chriſts Kingdom may come upon us in this Land; and that ſpeedily, and before his final judgment, by reaſon of our grand impieties: I mean, his coming in wrath, and vengeance, to bruiſe us with his <hi>Rod of iron,</hi> mentioned, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 2. 9. for

ſo he came to the <hi>Jews</hi> at their laſt and terrible deſtruction, of which Kingdom, <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt ſpake, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>Repent for the Kingdom of God is at hand: The Axis layd unto the root of the Trees:</hi> as if he had pointed to the <hi>Roman</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers, whoſe Enſign of Magiſtracy was <hi>an Ax;</hi> and ſome after our Savior tels them of their <hi>hewing down,</hi> Mat. 7. 10. &amp; Mat. 42. 34. <hi>This gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſhall not paſs till all theſe things be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,]</hi> i. e. that ſome, then alive, ſhould live till the deſtruction of <hi>Jernſalem</hi> ſhould be finiſhed. And when he foretold, that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould be crucified; even then he ſaid of St. <hi>John, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?</hi> the meaning was, that Chriſts coming in ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance <note place="margin">Joh. 21. 22.</note> upon that City and Nation, ſhould be before the death of St. <hi>John,</hi> as indeed it was, for he lived many years after the deſtruction of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi> In this ſence Chriſts Kingdom may come, and his Reigning; as a King, juſtly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king revenge, and puniſhing his rebellious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and we may juſtly fear that this Kingdom is already begun among us for our <hi>cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſins,</hi> even the ſins of the Afflicting, as well as the afflicted party. I do well remember that at the beginning of our late wars, an order from the Parliament, commanded the <hi>London</hi> Preachers to declare in their Pulpits, that theſe troubles came upon this Land, for the ſins thereof.</p>
               <p>Neither ſhould thoſe men, who are imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in executing the wrath of God upon others, think, that themſelves are Gods favorires, or <hi>Saints</hi> any thing more for this; becauſe they

                     <hi>That the Millinarian hereſie is ſcandalous againſt the Trinity, becauſe it is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement of the Son of God. Mr. Mede's argument for Millinariſme is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</hi>

               <p>THere is yet another <hi>Scandal,</hi> or ſtumbling block againſt the Divinity of the ſecond Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, lately laid again, by a new revival of an old hereſie of the Chiliaſts, or Millinarians; who taught that Chriſt ſhall return to earth corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a thouſand years before his coming to the final and univerſal judgment, and then his Saints which ſhall riſe from death, and thoſe Saints which he ſhall find living, ſhall begin their reign in this world as in a new earthly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, in all plentie of meats, and other world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and carnal pleaſures and delights, juſt as <hi>Turks do now believe,</hi> and that all earthly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions ſhall be theirs, that other men which are not Saints, ſhall either be ſlain, or at the beſt, ſo many of them ſhall be reſerved as may ſerve for vaſſalage to be triumphed over, and to do all kinds of drudgery works for the Saints.

                     <hi>eſt futurum, id neceſſario inter u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trumque eſt concludendum; nam poſt ultimam reſurrectionem, Chriſtus Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num tradet patri,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 24. <hi>Ergo novum non inibit. Which is thus En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhed by</hi> Mr. Rich: More, <hi>the learned tranſlator of that Book, pag.</hi> 122.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That Kingdom, which neither ſhall be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the appearance of our Lord, nor after the laſt Reſurrection; is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to be concluded between them both. For after the laſt Reſurrection univerſal, Chriſt ſhall deliver up the Kingdom to the Father, that he may be ſubject to him who ſubdueth all things to himſelf, as is ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24 25. 26. 27. 28. So far is he from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaid then to enter upon any new Kingdom, that he is to lay it down and deliver it up to his Father.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This argument is grounded upon one certain truth, viz. That <hi>Chriſt muſt have a Kingdom,</hi> which can not be denied. But it is alſo groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon two untruths, i. e. That <hi>Chriſt ſhall corporally return to this earth, before his coming to the univerſal judgment.</hi> 2. <hi>That Chriſt ſhall have no Kingdom after the laſt judgment.</hi> Theſe two are falſe grounds, or at leaſt are reducible to that fallacy which by Logicians is called <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titio Principii,</hi> i. e. when that is preſumed to be granted which is the main queſtion, and in no wiſe to be granted. Now if it may appear, that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:96408:60"/>
Chriſt muſt have a Kingdom after the final judgment, and that eternally in Heaven; then there wil be no need of his corporal deſcending, and appearing on this earth, before the laſt judgment for any eſtabliſhment, or manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or, for proving of his Kingdom; becauſe he ſhall have a Kingdom, though not on earth, or although he do not corporally ſo come as the Milliniarians expect.</p>
               <p>What the meaning of thoſe words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle is, which mention Chriſts <hi>delivering up the Kingdom,</hi> and <hi>the ſubjection of the Son,</hi> we ſhall examine anon, but certainly they do not in the leaſt, ſignifie the ending, or aboliſhing of Chriſts Kingdom, or any abaſing, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting of his Divine Perſon; for to affirm that Chriſt ſhall ceaſe to be a King, and that he ſhall turn ſubject, muſt be confeſſed by all learned and true Chriſtians, to be not only he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical, but alſo blaſphemous againſt the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God-head of the Son of God, and it is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly againſt the Scripture and ſure word of God; for this very word, <hi>Subject,</hi> was the argument of <hi>Arius</hi> and his Sect againſt the God-head of Chriſt, which is here uſed againſt the Eternal Kingdom of Chriſt as we read in <note n="a" place="margin">

both in this world, and the next, is plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully declared both in the old and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as firſt in that ſaying of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which <hi>Mr. Mede</hi> alledged againſt this truth, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>There was given him a Kingdom, that all People, Nations, and Languages ſhould ſerve him, his Dominion is an Everlaſting Dominion, which ſhall not paſs away, and his Kingdom, that ſhall not be deſtroyed.]</hi> Firſt, here is a Kingdom over the world, or, over all nations. 2. A King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom everlaſting and leaſt men ſhould imagine, that the <hi>Everlaſtingneſs</hi> of it, was meant only for its continuance till the end of the world, he addeth. 3. <hi>Which ſhall not paſs away]</hi> as the world will paſs away, and <hi>which ſhall not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed]</hi> as the world muſt be deſtroyed. This Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> concerning Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is confirmed in the Goſpel, by the words of that Heavenly Angel, <hi>Luc.</hi> 1. 33. <hi>He ſhall reigne over the houſe of Jacob for ever, and of his Kingdom there ſhall be no end.]</hi> Here is an <hi>ever,</hi> over <hi>Iacob;</hi> (that is) his Church<hi>:</hi> And that his reigning may not be thought to be only in the Church <hi>Militant;</hi> the Angel addeth, <hi>Of his Kingdom there ſhall be no end]</hi> if no end, then ſurely, it muſt not end with the world. The ſame Doctrine is declared by the Apoſtle, concerning the ſame Son of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 8. which he received from the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 6. <hi>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever.]</hi> here are two evers.

               <p>But then it muſt be inquired, what is meant by Chriſts <hi>delivering up the Kingdom;</hi> And in what ſence it is ſaid that <hi>Then ſhall the Son him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be ſubject.]</hi> To which inquiries, the reader may find a full, and I truſt, a ſatisfactory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in my <hi>former book printed An.

               <p>Firſt, Chriſts <hi>delivering up the Kingdom,</hi> doth not ſignifie his relinquiſhing or reſigning, but only a preſenting of his Kingdom; that is, his Church, his Spouſe, his Members and Elect, ſo ſaith the Expoſiter, <note n="c" place="margin">

                  <hi>Non ſic tradet, ut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimat ſibi,</hi> i. e. he will not ſo deliver it up, as if he had deprived himſelf of it. Juſt ſo the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is ſaid to have <hi>delivered all things to the Son,</hi> Luc. 10. 22. as he was man, and the head of his Church, yet for all this delivering, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Dominion over all, did not ceaſe; As when a Prince committeth a Province to the Goverment of one of his Captains, the Prince doth not thereby loſe his Soveraignity, as the Father delivered his people to the Son to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, ſo that the Son re-deliver the ſame people to the Father, but in better condition then he found them, for he will preſent them <hi>righteous, holy, pure, juſt, and free from all ſin, or</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:96408:61"/>
                  <hi>matter of reproof.</hi> Chriſt received them to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, and he governed them ſo well, that in the end, he will preſent them to the juſt God-head to be rewarded, and crowned. The Church on earth, whilſt it is <hi>Militant,</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>Black and comely,</hi> Cant. 1. 5. viz. <hi>Black,</hi> by reaſon of ſome pollutions of ſin; and <hi>Comely,</hi> becauſe it is adorned with many graces; but when Chriſt ſhall preſent it to the Father at the end of the world, it ſhall be delivered up, <hi>Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and not Black.</hi> So that this delivering, is only a preſenting of his Church, which is his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as good Students, after their labours are preſented to the Univerſity as <hi>Candidates</hi> to be rewarded with the honour of Degrees; or as <hi>Queen Eſther,</hi> when ſhe was purified, was ſo <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſther</hi> 2.</note> preſented to King <hi>Ahaſuerus.</hi> This is all that reaſonably can be gathered from the phraſe of <hi>Delivering up the Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly. The <hi>Subjection of the Son,</hi> is thus to be underſtood. We know that Chriſt, as he is man, is called the <hi>head of the Church]</hi> Epheſ. 5. 23. And the Church is called <hi>The body of Chriſt]</hi> Col. 1. 18. of this great body, all holy Chriſtians with Chriſt himſelf, are members and parts, (for the head is but a part of the whole body) ſo that Chriſt the head, and all his Saints and members are joyntly but one <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical body or Corporation,</hi> and ſo but <hi>one Chriſt.</hi> So we read, <hi>We are members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones,]</hi> Epheſ. 5. 30. And <hi>Ye are all one in Chriſt Jeſus]</hi> Gal. 3. 28. from theſe, and the like ſayings, the Ancient Fathers collected this true and excellent Doctrine. That
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:96408:62"/>
Chriſt the head, together with all his members or Church; are to be accounted but <hi>one Chriſt</hi> which they called <hi>Christum univerſum, and Chriſtum totum, and Chriſtum diffuſum, and Chriſtum plenum; and Plenitudinem Chriſti,</hi> i. e. The univerſall, whole, diffuſed, and the full Chriſt, or fulneſs of Chriſt, as I have formerly ſhewed at larg.</p>
               <p>Now, when the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>Then ſhall the Son himſelf be ſubject]</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 28. his meaning is only this, that all the members of Chriſt, and ſo the <hi>Whole Chriſt</hi> ſhall be at the reſurrection fully and compleatly, and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubject, and obediently plyable to the will of God, for then all the holy members of Chriſt ſhall be delivered up, or preſented to God, <hi>pure, ſpotleſs, quit, and free from all the dominion of the World, the fleſh and the Devil,</hi> which before during this mortal life, had ſome power in them, whilſt they were <hi>militant,</hi> and in war, by the Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rit, againſt the fleſh<hi>:</hi> but then Chriſt ſhall have put down <hi>all Rule, all Authority and Power of ſin,</hi> ſo that they ſhall not be any longer <hi>militant,</hi> but <hi>triumphant:</hi> ſo that then, and not till then, the <hi>whole Chriſt,</hi> that is, not only himſelf as head, but all his members with him ſhall be perfectly obedient, and ſubject in all things to the God-head.</p>
               <p>For before this delivering up, or preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Kingdom, or Church; <hi>The whole Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>whole body of Chriſt,</hi> as it never yet was, ſo it never will be compleatly and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubjected to the will and rule of God, becauſe all the members of Chriſt will not till then be
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:96408:62"/>
fully obedient: for although Chriſt, as he is man, and as he is conſidered only by himſelf, in his own particular humane perſon, without relation to us, was ever obedient, and ſubject to the God-head, yet this ſubjection of his particular ſelf was only <hi>in capite,</hi> i. e. a ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one part, the head only; but at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, when he ſhall preſent, and deliver up this his Kingdom, or Church, then both head and members, and ſo the <hi>whole Chriſt</hi> ſhall be perfectly and wholy ſubjected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Finally,</hi> although Chriſt himſelf, as he is the Son of Man, and in the form of a ſervant was ever ſubject; yet the ſame Lord Jeſus, as he is the Son of God, and <hi>in the form of God,</hi> Philip. 2. 6. <hi>he thought it no robbery to be equal with God,</hi> and therefore, as he is God the <hi>Word,</hi> or the <hi>Eternal Son</hi> of the Eternal Father, in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his divine Perſon, he never was, nor ever ſhall be ſubject.

                  <p>It being granted that Chriſt is now a Prieſt in Heaven, it would be inquired of what order, or kind, his Prieſthood is there in this we are certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that it is a Prieſthood for ever; and that it is after or according <hi>to the Prieſthood of Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech,</hi> (that is) Chriſt is ſuch a Prieſt in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was on Earth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt in Heaven doth ſuch Prieſtly acts, as <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> did on earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:96408:73"/>
For Chriſt, whileſt he was on earth, was a Prieſt, but here his Prieſthood was <hi>Aaronical,</hi> i. e. like unto Aarons Prieſthood, becauſe Chriſt did offer a bloody ſacrifice, even his own body and blood on the Altar of the Croſs, which he gave for a <hi>ranſom for us,</hi> Mat. 20. 28. <hi>For a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation,</hi> Ro. 3. 25. <hi>for our Justification,</hi> Ro. 5. 9. <hi>for our Redemption,</hi> Eph. 1. 7. Col. 1. 14. <hi>to bear our ſins in his own body,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 24.] (that is) to undergo the puniſhment for our ſins, paying <hi>the ranſom of his own ſelf for us,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 6. This bloody ſacrifice of Chriſt, was typified, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignified by <hi>Aaron,</hi> offering the bodies and blood of Beaſts.</p>
                  <p>But the ſacrifice of Chriſt on earth, was alſo <hi>unlike</hi> Aarons; becauſe Aaron offered beaſts, but Chriſt offered himſelf; Aaron might not offer human blood, nor might Chriſt offer the blood of Beaſts; whereupon it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 4. <hi>That Chriſt on earth could not be a Prieſt, becauſe he could not offer gifts according to the Law]</hi> (that is) he could not offer Levitical Sacrifices of Beaſts as the Legal Prieſts did, becauſe he was not a Son of <hi>Aaron,</hi> or of the <hi>Tribe of Levi.</hi> But he might and did offer his own humane blood, which was the Subſtance, whereas the blood of Beaſts offered by Aaron, was but only the ſhadow.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, they that tell us, that Chriſt may not be called an <hi>Aaronicall Prieſt,</hi> becauſe he was not a Son of <hi>Aaron;</hi> may as well tell us, that he may not be called <hi>The Lamb,</hi> becauſe he was not literally <hi>a Lamb, taken out of the Sheep-fold]</hi> The truth is this.

but the ſhadow of Chriſts Paſſion, ſo the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Aaron was but the ſhadow of Chriſts Sacrificing Prieſthood.

                  <p>If it be demanded why Chriſt doth not pray
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:96408:74"/>
in Heaven as he did on earth before his death? We anſwer, 1. He prayed before his death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe till then he had not paid our ranſom by his precious blood and death. 2. Becauſe he had fully ſatisfied the Juſtice of the God-head before his Aſcenſion, even to the utmoſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; therefore after this ſatisfaction, there could be no need, or uſe of further praying. 3. When he aſcended he took poſſeſſion of Heaven, not only for himſelf or for his own proper humane nature, but alſo for, and in the behalf of his whole myſtical corporation, and every member thereof: therefore now, no need of praying for that; for, neither do we petition for things that are already granted, and by us obtained and poſſeſſed. Our Saviour, after his meritorious life, and perfect obedience Active, and after his ſatisfactory death, and thereby his perfect obedience paſſive, whereby the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Law was fully performed and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, had no cauſe at all in his own, or our behalf to petition, but might and did juſtly challeng Heaven as due to himſelf; and in him, to his whole body, and every member thereof.</p>

conſideration of the Reader, the four queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons following.</p>
                  <p>Firſt. <hi>What it is in Chriſt, that is ſo exalted,]</hi> To this, we ſay, That Chriſt conſiſteth of two ingredients, viz <hi>God head</hi> and <hi>Man hood,</hi> and that this ſitting at the Right hand is not to be underſtood of his God-head, but of his Man-hood, as he is the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> the <hi>Son of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> the <hi>Son of the Virgin-Mother,</hi> for by this humane nature, he became paſſible, ſubject to poverty, hunger and thirſt, wearineſs, injuries, buffetings, ſcourging and death; therefore as by this part only, he is ſaid to be humbled to death; the <hi>Death of the Croſs,</hi> ſo in this part only may he be ſaid to be exalted, for by his God-head he ever was at the Right hand of God, and <hi>God over all bleſſed for ever.</hi> As he <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 5.</note> is <hi>God the word,</hi> he can not be ſaid to be exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but as <hi>the word was made fleſh.</hi> It is our nature only, that the Son of God ennobled, and carried to the right hand of God; and we have ſhewed before, that the prophecies of Chriſt's exaltation, were ſaid only of the <hi>Son of David,</hi> that is, of Chriſts humane nature, for otherwiſe he is not the Son of David.</p>
                  <p>If it be ſaid, that we may not ſeperate his God-head, from his Man-hood, for this is to make two Perſons of one, and was the hereſie of <hi>Neſtorius:</hi> To this we anſwer, That it is true, that the two natures of Chriſt, neither can, nor may be ſevered or divided aſunder by any <hi>Real ſeparation;</hi> but yet they may and muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, ſeparated or <hi>abſtracted, mentally,</hi> or <hi>Mathematically:</hi> as School-men ſay) that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:96408:77"/>
is, we may in our mind conſider one part alone, without conſidering the other, although both do really conſiſt together, as a <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician,</hi> conſidereth the <hi>longitude</hi> of a body, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſidering the matter of it. So we, in this exaltation of Chriſt, conſider only his humane, or aſſumed nature. This is the judgment of the Ancient Church, delivered by Theodoret, <note n="a" place="margin">Theo.

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Who it is that ſo exalted Chriſt.</hi> Whether the Perſon of the Father, only; or the Perſon of the Holy Ghoſt; or whether the Son exalted himſelf; To this we anſwer, that the whole God-head, and every Divine Perſon therein; exalted Chriſt; even the God-head of the Lord Jeſus, exalted the Manhood of the ſame Lord Jeſus; for, there is but one God-head in all the Three Perſons, therefore all the Three Perſons exalted the humane nature of the Son; This truth, the Scripture often ſheweth though ſomething myſteriouſly; for, David ſaith of Chriſt, <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit</hi>

                     <hi>thou at my right hand,]</hi> That is, The God-head of the Son of God ſaid to Chriſt, for David calls Chriſt, <hi>His Lord,</hi> only for this reaſon, becauſe the Lord Chriſt was to be the <hi>Son of David,</hi> by taking fleſh from David; for otherwiſe, how is not the Lord that ſaid it, Davids Lord; as well as the Lord to whom it was ſaid? This is that Scripture wherewith Chriſt poſed the Phariſees. <hi>If David call him Lord, how is he his Son?</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid <note place="margin">

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:96408:77"/>
he was to be the <hi>Son of David</hi> by his aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med humane nature; <hi>His Divine Nature was Davids Lords; his humane Nature was Davids Son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame David had ſaid before of Chriſt, <hi>God, thy God hath anoynted thee with the oyl of gladneſs,]</hi> The meaning is, that the God-head <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 7.</note> of Jeſus, was to be the Anoynter and the Oyl and Unction of Jeſus; and therefore the God-head, is called <hi>his God,</hi> becauſe the Lord Jeſus, by his God-head, anoynted Chriſt, or, <hi>The Son of God anoynted, and exalted the Son of Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So Chriſt, on the Croſs, ſaid, <hi>My God, my</hi>

                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 46.</note> 
                     <hi>God, why haſt thou forſaken me,]</hi> Now did Chriſt ſpeak to his own God-head. The Son of Man ſpake to the Son of God, which he therefore calls <hi>his</hi> God. The <hi>forſaking</hi> here mentioned is not ſo to be conſtrued, or underſtood, as if now in this agonie, his God-head had quite departed from him, or, that the union of the God-head and Manhood were then diſſolved; far be it from us to think ſo; but the meaning is, that his God-head did now expoſe, and give up, and deliver the Manhood to death, and left it to the will and fury of that People. The God-head ſuſpended, and with-held protection from the manhood, and did not ſend Legions of Angels to deliver him, although the God-head was ſtill united with the Manhood.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly. <hi>At whoſe Right hand Chriſt is ſaid to ſit.]</hi> Whether at the Right-hand of one, or of all the Perſons of the Trinity; This I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive requiſite to be examined; becauſe all our
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:96408:78"/>
                     <hi>Liturgical Symbols, or Creeds,</hi> mention Chriſt's ſitting <hi>at,</hi> or <hi>on</hi> the <hi>Right-hand of the Father:</hi> which is certainly true, becauſe every Perſon in the Trinity is the Creator, and therefore the <hi>Father of all Creatures,</hi> although only the Perſon of the Father is to be acknowledged to be <hi>Father of the Word, or Son of God.</hi> But yet, this <hi>Symbolical expreſſion</hi> doth not ſo cleerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare this Myſtery, as the words of the holy Scriptures do; wherein Chriſt is never ſaid to <hi>ſit at the right hand of the Father,</hi> but <hi>at the right hand of God:</hi> Now the right hand of God, is the right hand of every Perſon in the God-head, and not only the right hand of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Father. So that the meaning of this ſitting of Chriſt, muſt be this: That the humane nature of Chriſt is advanced to ſit at the right hand of the God-head, and ſo at the right hand, both of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt<hi>:</hi> that is, <hi>The Son of Man is advanced to ſit at the right hand of the Son of God;</hi> or thus, Mans nature, in Chriſt, is advanced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all Angels, and Arch-angels, and above all Creatures in Heaven and Earth, and under the Earth, and above all infernal powers, and that it is in honour, and power immediatly next to the ſupream God-head.</p>
                  <p>The mis-underſtanding of thoſe words in the <hi>Creeds,</hi> which mention Chriſt's <hi>ſitting on the right hand of the Father,</hi> hath occaſioned a great abuſe in mens apprehenſion; for, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

both) a third Seat for the Holy Ghoſt, whereby they have advanced Chriſt, above the Holy Ghoſt; but we are well aſſured that it is both againſt our Chriſtian Faith, and alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that any one Perſon in the Trinity ſhould be above the other becauſe all are <hi>Coê<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual;</hi> and it is as impoſſible that any Creature ſhould be above God the Creator (for the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature of Chriſt is that which only is ſo advanced, and that nature, is a Creature) This abuſe was foreſeen by St. Paul (as may be thought) and therefore by him care was taken to prevent it, by thoſe words, <hi>He hath put all</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>things under his feet.]</hi> that is, All creatures are by the God-head, made ſubject to the man Chriſt<hi>:</hi> it follows: <hi>But when he ſaith all things are put under him, it is manifeſt, that he is excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted which did put all things under him,]</hi> (that is) Although all creatures are now under the Man Chriſt, yet neither the God head, nor any Perſon therein are under Chriſt, his Manhood is next in glory to God, but in no wiſe above him, or any Perſon in the Trinity.</p>

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:96408:80"/>
as <hi>Jews, and Millinarians</hi> now do; this earthly monarchy ſo filled their thoughts, that they were not capable of the Comforter, they thought Chriſt could not reign except his body were preſent, ſo that his God-head was not conſidered, but altogether neglected. The holy Woman <hi>Martha</hi> greatly erred in this very thing, when ſhe ſaid, <hi>Lord if thou hadſt been</hi>

                  <p>To cure them of this fond conceit, Chriſt withdraws to Heaven, as a Mother withdraws her preſence from a too fond Child, and as light and food are ſometimes withheld from Frantick men for their good, for this cauſe, it may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be thought, that Chriſt performed ſome miraculous cures on earth, when he was not corporally preſent, thereby to teach men the omni-preſence of his Divine Spirit; for ſo, he cured the <hi>Centurious Servant,</hi> not going to <note place="margin">

                  <p>Theſe premiſes being true, and all of them matters of Faith, it may be wondred that any Chriſtian ſhould dream of removing the Court Royall of Chriſt from Heaven to this baſe, and beggerly earth; <hi>Faustus</hi> the Manichean thought more honorably of Chriſt then ſo, and ſaid,

                  <p>And yet I do not think it unprobable, but that before the end of this world, there will be ſome ſuch thing attempted, as <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linarians</hi> phanſie, concerning this <hi>Earthly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of Meſſiah:</hi> the Jews poſſibly may be congregated to their old country; <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the <hi>Temple</hi> there, may be rebuilt; and that People may be the moſt potent upon earth; Their <hi>Captain,</hi> or Leader that ſhall ſo congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate them, may by them, be thought, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, to be their <hi>long-expected Meſsiah.</hi> Thoſe Chriſtians that then ſhall joyn with the Jews, and their <hi>Leader,</hi> may be thought by themſelves, and by the Jews to be <hi>Proſelite-Saints,</hi> and ſo together they may have a <hi>Sovereignty</hi> over all other worldly Princes.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>Expiation.]</hi> This word ſignifies, purging, purifying, hallowing, cleanſing, appeaſing, delivering from the guilt of ſin, and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to a State of Piety, who by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion hath faln into a ſtate of impiety. This Feſtival was therefore called the Feaſt of <hi>Expiation,</hi> becauſe therein was Typically ſhewed, the means whereby ſinful man was
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:96408:83"/>
to be reſtored to innocency and to be quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and purged from the guilt of ſin.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>Reconciliation,]</hi> This Feaſt was ſo called, becauſe therein was figuratively ſhewed how ſinful man is to be <hi>Reconciled</hi> to his offended God.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>Propitiation,]</hi> it was ſo called, becauſe it typically ſhewed who it is, by whoſe media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and interceſſion, the God-head is made propitious, and favourable, and by whom we are ingraciated with God, or, who is the <hi>Proportiation for our ſins,</hi> of whom we read, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 2.</p>

                  <p>In this great myſterious Feſtival, many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are very conſiderable for the buſineſſe now in hand.</p>
                  <p>Firſt. <hi>The High Prieſt was to enter into the</hi>

                     <hi>moſt Holy place, alone, none with him,</hi> Lev. 16. 17. This was, to teach us that Chriſt alone is he that taketh away ſins, and worketh our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:96408:84"/>
reconciliation, and atonement or reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the offended God-head.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. <hi>The High Prieſt went not into that Sanctuary, until the Sacrifical beaſts were killed,</hi> one for the Atonement of the Prieſts, and after, the other for the Atonement of the people, and their blood reſpectively taken, verſ. 11. 15. So Chriſt, did not actually expiate us, but by his death, and blood, ſhedding his own blood.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly. <hi>The High Prieſt preſented two Goats before the Lord,</hi> verſ. 7. One was killed, the other was kept alive. v. 7. 13. Both the Goats repreſented Chriſt. That which was killed at the Tabernacle, ſignified, that the benefit of Chriſts death was tendered, and offered to the Iſraelites, or people of the Tabernacle. The other, which was reſerved alive, and ſent away into the wilderneſs ſignified that Chriſt, with all his efficacies and benefits ſhould by his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, be ſent and tendered, and preſented to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or <hi>Nations,</hi> who in the Scriptures are often called the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> and <hi>Solitary place,</hi> or <hi>deſert,</hi> as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35. 1. For, in Chriſt <hi>all the Nations of the earth are to be bleſſed,</hi> Gen. 18. 18. <hi>The gathering of the people,</hi> (expectatio gentium) <hi>ſhall be unto him,</hi> Gen. 49. 10. he was to be <hi>a light to lighten the Gentiles,</hi> Luc. 2. 23. And Chriſt himſelf profeſſed that <hi>he hath other Sheep which were not of this</hi> (Jewiſh) <hi>fold,</hi> Joh. 19. 16.</p>
                  <p>Some Expoſiters (as <hi>Theodoret. and Both the Gloſſes with Lyranus)</hi> have thought, that this <hi>Hircus Apopompeus,</hi> i. e. the Emiſſary, or Scape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goat, ſignified the God-head of Chriſt, which
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:96408:84"/>

This is the principal ceremony of all, and teacheth us the full intent, and purpoſe of all the Jewiſh Sacrifices, and how, only, they could be uſeful, and beneficial to the Jews, and to us alſo; and how the true, and ſubſtantial <hi>Atonement,</hi> or <hi>reconciliation</hi> of God with man was to be made.</p>

It was called the <hi>Propitiatory,</hi> becauſe by

Chriſt only, the God-head is reconciled, and made propitious to man; t'was alſo called the <hi>Oracle,</hi> becauſe, as God ſpake to Moſes from this Mercy Seat, <hi>Numb.</hi> 7. 89.

                  <p>Upon this Mercy Seat was the blood of thoſe <hi>Piacular Sacrifices</hi> to be ſprinkled,] This ſignified, that all the Jewiſh Sacrifices, and blood of beaſts, were not of any value, or force at all to acquit, and redeem man, but only as they related to Chriſt, as ſhadows, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of the blood of Chriſt, that the blood of beaſts did not at all propitiate of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, until they were reduced, and by Faith brought home to Chriſt; ſo that thoſe Jews which offered the blood of beaſts, without the faith of <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and looked no further then upon the beaſts only, nor did conſider and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that the <hi>Meſsiah</hi> was to pour out his own blood for them, and that thoſe Sacrifices were ordained for none other end but to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them, and dayly put them in mind of their redemption by the death of their <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> and ſo to nouriſh continually their Faith, and hope in him<hi>:</hi> Their Sacrifices were vain.</p>

Chriſt lifted up on the Croſs: So that thoſe Jews who in their ſacrificing did not by faith conſider this, ſacrificed no better then the Heathens did, and upon this very reaſon God condemned their ſacrifices, and moreover pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that they were odious unto him<hi>:</hi> for ſo he ſaith, <hi>I have no delight in the blood of Bullocks,</hi>

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:96408:86"/>
ſacrifice was to be <hi>ſprinkled on the Mercy ſeat,</hi> that is, <hi>on Chriſt,</hi> for what elſe can be the Seat of the Mercy of the God-head but only Chriſt, in whom only God is appeaſed, ſatisfied, and well pleaſed. In a word; No blood could ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the Juſtice of the God-head, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile God to man, but only that blood which was ſprinkled on this <hi>Mercy Seat,</hi> viz. on the bleſſed body of the <hi>Son of Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The blood of the Sacrifice was to be ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>ſeven times</hi> on the Mercy Seat,] <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 14. This ſignified, that the blood of Chriſt made a perfect reconciliation, and was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to expiate, for all times, and ages, from the beginning of the world, to the end thereof; becauſe all times are included in this number of ſeven; there are but <hi>ſeven dayes</hi> created; All times are but thoſe ſeven dayes reiterated.</p>
                  <p>As the Jewiſh Sacrifices were inſtituted, only to be a repreſentation of Chriſt's Sacrifice, ſo our Chriſtian Sacrifices of prayers are an after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorial thereof, for we ask, petition, and pray for all things, in, and <hi>through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> The Jewiſh <hi>Liturgie</hi> was only <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> The <hi>Chriſtian Sacrifice,</hi> is only prayers, thoſe are <hi>the calves of our lips.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Jews were limited to a certainty, and ſet form of Sacrifices, they might not ſacrifice any beaſt, but only of the <hi>Neat, Sheep and Goat,</hi> nor any foul, but only <hi>Doves.</hi> None other beaſt, though never ſo great or precious, not an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn (if any were) not an Elephant, nor any other foul, not an high neckt Swan, nor a proud Peacock.</p>

                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:96408:87"/>
The Church Catholick in correſpondence thereunto, had their limited liturgies, and ſet forms of publick prayer, as we find in all ages ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles, none might publickly in the Congregation offer the ſtang, or wildfier of his own phanſie, but was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the form preſcribed, that ſo the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation might knowingly joyn therein.

This by the way.</p>
                  <p>Now for concluſion of this queſtion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the correſpondence of Chriſt in Heaven, with the High Prieſt in the Sanctuary, I deſire the learned Reader to peruſe the whole paſſage in that great Feſtival of <hi>Atonement,</hi> deſcribed <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. and then judg whether there be any mention at all, of the High Prieſts Sacrificing in the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum;</hi> he will find that the Sacrifice was by him offered, not within, but without the ſanctuary, at the Great <hi>Altar;</hi> ſo was the Sacrifice of the body and blood of Chriſt offered, not within the Sanctuary of Heaven, but on the <hi>Groſs,</hi> which was his <hi>Altar</hi> on earth; the denial whereof containeth more poyſon, then a plain Chriſtian is aware of.</p>
                  <p>If our Commenter had been contented to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm only this, That Chriſt preſenteth his holy body in Heaven, which was beſprinkled with his own blood here on earth, wee would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly agree with him therein; for certainly his Paſſion on earth is, and ever will be looked on in
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:96408:87"/>
Heaven, and conſidered by the Godhead, as a full ſatisfaction, and expiation for all his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and will ever be preſent, and freſh in the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p>For if Chriſt had not fully ſatisfied the Divine Juſtice, and paid the full price of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at his death; he could not have <hi>aſcended</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, nor ſate at the <hi>Right Hand of God,</hi> but muſt ſtill have been held in Priſon by death as other dead men are; becauſe he was indebted by the <hi>Covenant,</hi> as being <hi>a ſurety</hi> for man: But now, that our ſurety is freed, and out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, there is no doubt, but that the debt was fully paid before his releaſment. This is all that I ſhall need to relate concerning the Hiſtory of Chriſt in Heaven, for if all could be written, (as St <hi>John</hi> ſaid of him upon Earth,) <hi>The World it</hi>

                  <head>The Concluſion.</head>
                  <p>THE Church of <hi>England</hi> is at this day much diſſetled, by many <hi>Scandals,</hi> and revivals of old <hi>Errors;</hi> and it is alſo disfurniſhed of many an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and laudable uſances (as hath been ſhewed) and moreover, many other rites of great concernment, are either quite gone, or much out of uſe. For now, the Adminiſtration of the <hi>Holy Supper</hi> (the grand comfort of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) is ſo rare, that in many congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it hath not been adminiſtred above once in ten years. The uniformity of <hi>publick prayer,</hi> and worſhip, which our Anceſtors eſtabliſhed, and gloryed in, is quite gone; So is the reverend De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of <hi>Chriſtian Burial,</hi> and the Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotal <hi>benediction of Matrimony,</hi> and alſo
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:96408:96"/>
the Eccleſiaſtical cognizance thereof, which ſurely, ſhould be in the Church, becauſe, the Apoſtle not only giveth precepts concerning matrimony, but <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</note> alſo paſſed an Eccleſiaſtical cenſure upon <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5.</note> the tranſgreſſor thereof.</p>
                  <p>Though all theſe are taken from us, and many other things alſo (beſides Eccleſiaſtical Lively-hoods,) yet (in the name of God,) let us ſtill hold faſt the Faith, and confeſſion of the <hi>Holy Trinity</hi> even to death; for if that go away, all Chriſtianity will go with it.</p>
                  <p>There was in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in the days of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the elder, a parechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which formerly was called the Church of <hi>Alexander,</hi> but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it was named <hi>Anaſtaſia, i. e.</hi> the <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and this for many reaſons, but principally, becauſe in that Church, <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> had revived the Faith and Doctrine of the Trinity by his Preaching, which before had been by Hereticks quite extinguiſhed and buried, therefore this Church was called the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> as <hi>Sozomen</hi> reports, <note n="a" place="margin">
